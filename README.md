# FUN WITH POLYGONS - COMPUTER GRAPHICS PROJECT

## ABOUT THE PROJECT

The project is designed for supporting different transformation functions and event driven function of OpenGL on primary objects. The project implements the generation of various polygons on the basis of the polygons order entered by the User.

## DESCRIPTION

- A Polygon is a 2D shape which is made up of straight line segments. A regular polygon has all sides and angles equal (e.g.  a square is a regular quadrilateral).

- In elementary geometry, a polygon is a plane figure that is described by a finite number of straight line segments connected to form a closed polygonal chain or polygonal circuit. The solid plane region, the bounding circuit, or the two together, may be called a polygon.

- A regular polygon is a polygon with all angles and all sides congruent, or equal. Here are some regular polygons.

- We can use a formula to find the sum of the interior angles of any polygon. In this formula, the letter n stands for the number of sides, or angles, that the polygon has.
```Sum of angles = (n – 2)180°```
Polygons are named after the number of sides they have.

## FEATURES

-	The important feature of this project is we can generate various polygons on the given order of a polygon.
-	The generated polygons view are aesthetically pleasing and eye-catching.
-	We can easily move the polygon in upper, lower, left, and right directions.
-	We can generate the polygons with various order which are specified by the user (ie) the order of the polygon is taken as input from the user.
-	There is a proper movement of the polygons.
-	Keyboard interrupts are used for movement of the polygon in clockwise and anti-clockwise manner.
-	Mouse interrupts are also used for movement of the polygon in different perspectives.
-	There is a proper delay in the movement of the polygon.
-	The generation of the polygons take very less time. 

## PRE-REQUISITES
- Install CodeBlocks software from [codeblocks-17.12mingw-setup.exe](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26).
- Set up [freeglut library](https://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/) to codeblocks folder as shown in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPcnymtP2SE).
- Or have linux environment to execute this code.
